<h1>Burning Ship Fractal</h1>
This project combines the visual beauty of the Burning Ship fractal with synchronized audio generated using C for the fractals and Sonic Pi for the music.
<h2>Description</h2>
The Burning Ship fractal is a variation of the Mandelbrot set, known for its intriguing shape resembling a ship on fire. In this project, I leverage C programming to generate the Burning Ship fractal, producing mesmerizing visual patterns. Additionally, I use Sonic Pi, a live coding music synth, to create a dynamic audio accompaniment that synchronizes with the fractal visualization.
